## How Was This App Made?
  This is a progressive web-application (PWA) built through test-driven development via Jest and Asastus.

  React components were mainly utilized and Recharts acted as a major dependency in showing data through pie-charts and scatterplots. Users can visit the app using this [link](https://henryn05.github.io/meet/).

## What Does This App Do?
  Upon opening the PWA, users will be prompted login via a 3rd party authorization server (Google OAuth).

  After logging in, the user can search for events in specific cities and/or change the number of events showing from the output. The output will display events that fit the user's selected criteria.

  The pie chart and scatterplot will be displayed above the outputted events and will reflect composition of the data based on the user's input.
